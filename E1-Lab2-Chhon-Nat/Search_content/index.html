                            Lingapura (city of lingams) or Chok Gargyar[2]: 70  (translated as city of glance,[3] or as
                            iron tree forest).[1]: 8–9

                            whose licenses honor and uphold the freedoms mentioned above. Because the Berne Convention
                            in most countries by default grants copyright holders monopolistic control over their

                            Although there are a great many different definitions in regular everyday use, free content
                            is legally very similar, if not like an identical twin, to open content. An analogy is a use
                            of the rival terms free software and open-source, which describe ideological differences
                            rather than legal ones.[3][4][5] For instance, the Open Knowledge Foundation's Open
                            Definition describes "open" as synonymous to the definition of free in the "Definition of
                            Free Cultural Works" (as also in the Open Source Definition and Free Software
                            Definition).[6] For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three Creative
                            Commons licenses, the CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0.[7][8][9][10]

                        <p>Koh Ker is situated between the southern slopes of the Dangrek mountains, the Kulen mountains
                            (Phnom Kulen) in the south-west, and the Tbeng mountain (Phnom Tbeng, near Tbeng Meanchey)
                            in the east. Most parts of the hilly ground are covered by jungle, but most of the trees
                            shed their leaves seasonally. The city of Koh Ker was on the most important strategic route
                            of the Khmer empire. Coming from Angkor and Beng Mealea to Koh Ker this road led to Prasat
                            Preah Vihear and from there to Phimai in Thailand and Wat Phu in Laos .[1]: 13–14  The
                            region of Koh Ker is relatively dry. Numerous water-tanks and canals were built during the
                            9th and the 10th century to ensure the water supply. These days water is pumped up from a
                            depth of 30 to 40 metres (98 to 131 ft) meters.[1]: 9 </p>

                        <p>Jayavarman IV ruled from 928 to 941 at Koh Ker. He was a believed to have been the local king
                            at this remote site, possibly his homeland, before he became king of the whole empire. That
                            could explain why he had his residence at Koh Ker and not at Roluos (Hariharalaya) or at
                            Yashodharapura (Angkor) like the kings before him. Some historians think that Jayavarman IV
                            was an usurper; but, the majority of them believe that he was a legitimate ruler who could
                            ascend to the throne because he married a half-sister of king Yasovarman I (889 – 900). What
                            is certain is that the two sons of Yasovarman I (Harshavarman I, who ruled from 900 to 922
                            and Isanavarman II, who ruled from 922 to 925?) had no children. In the short time that
                            Jayavarman IV reigned in Koh Ker, an ambitious building program was realised. That was only
                            possible because of a restrictive system of raising taxes as seen on inscriptions found at
                            the site. About 40 temples, the unique seven-tiered pyramid and a huge baray
                            (water-reservoir) were built. Under Jayavarman IV, the Koh Ker-style was developed and the
                            art of sculpture reached a pinnacle.[1]: 15 </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 id="Harshavarman-II"><strong>Harshavarman II</strong></h3>
                        <p>After the death of Jayavarman IV, the designated prince did not take his place. Harshavarman
                            II (another son of Jayavarman IV) claimed the throne. Like his father, he ruled at Koh Ker
                            (941 – 944) but after three years he died; likely not due to natural causes. None of the
                            temples at Koh Ker can be ascribed to him. His follower on the throne, a cousin of his,
                            returned Roluos (Hariharalaya) to the seat of power.[1]: 15 </p>

                        <p>Even after 944, as the capital of the Khmer Empire had changed back to the plains north of
                            the Tonle Sap-lake, more temples were built at the site of Koh Ker. An inscription mentions
                            the reign of Udayadityavarman I in 1001.[4]: 134  At the beginning of the 13th century the
                            last sanctuary was realised there. Under Jayavarman VII, the Prasat Andong Kuk, a so-called
                            hospital-chapel, was built, one of more than 100 of hospital-sanctuaries built under this
                            ruler.[1]: 15  [1]: 25 </p>

                        <p>In the second part of the 19th century, French adventurers ranged the forests around the site
                            of Koh Ker while hunting game. They brought word of the structures in the area back to
                            France. The French researchers Lunet de Lajonquière and Étienne Aymonier came to Koh Ker.
                            They saw the main temple-complex Prasat Thom/Prang, the Baray and a group of linga-shrines.
                            They also discovered a few subsections of a chaussée (i.e. highway) with a breadth of more
                            than 8 m (26 ft). They supposed that a road once connected Koh Ker with Wat Phu (today in
                            southern Laos). Around 1880, members of a French expedition arrived at Koh Ker and looted
                            numerous statues and reliefs. These pieces are now in the Musée Guimet in Paris.[1]: 13 </p>

                        <h3 id="20th-century"><strong>20th century</strong></h3>
                        <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, art historians realised that a full-fledged style was
                            developed at Koh Ker. Georges Coedès concluded from inscriptions that Koh Ker was capital of
                            the Khmer empire (928 – 944 AD) under the reign of Jayavarman IV and his follower
                            Harshavarman II. In the 1930s, again French researchers came to Koh Ker. They discovered
                            numerous monuments and counted fifty sanctuaries in an area of 35 square kilometres (8,649
                            acres). Henry Parmentier made a number of drawings. After an interruption because of the
                            reign of terror of the Khmer rouge, research at Koh Ker continued by APSARA, French,
                            Japanese and Australian scientists.[1]: 13 </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3 id="21st-century"><strong>21st century</strong></h3>
                        <p>At the beginning of the 21st century, scientists concluded that not all of the monuments
                            could have been built in the short time when Koh Ker was capital of the Khmer empire (928 –
                            944 AD). A new era started at Koh Ker as photographs made by satellites were analysed. In
                            2004 the protected area was extended to 81 square kilometres (31 sq mi; 20,016 acres). For
                            five years, Japanese researchers explored and described 184 monuments, including documenting
                            their exact locations. The Australian researcher Damian Evans and his team were able to
                            verify Lajonquière's theory that there once was a Khmer route between Koh Ker and Wat Phu,
                            probably the most important strategic road of the Khmer empire.[1]: 13–14 </p>
                        <p>Excavations in December 2015 by Cambodian and international teams near Prasat Thom and the
                            Rahal in the ancient urban core area of Koh Ker have yielded radiocarbon dates that clearly
                            place significant habitation and activity beginning as early as the 7th-8th centuries CE -
                            often noted as the Chenla period by historians. Some pottery types may date to the earlier
                            Funan period. Over 24,000 artifacts and ecofacts were recovered from three test sites.
                            Artifacts are mostly pottery fragments with local and exotic types representing over 1000
                            years of site use throughout the occupational sequence. Exotic pottery types include Chinese
                            stoneware and glazed ware from the Song Yuan periods. Other exotic pottery include Thai and
                            Vietnamese stoneware that generally date to the late Angkor and post-Angkor periods.
                            Possible Persian pottery dating to the 9th century has been noted as well. Thus, Koh Ker has
                            been linked to long distance value chains for considerable time spans. Although the area may
                            have been significantly repurposed during the 10th century construction-boom heyday of
                            Jayavarman IV, site use and activity continued well beyond the 10th century. Intensity of
                            activities and density of occupation may have oscillated over time in relation to political
                            and socio-economic factors. Natural and human resource management variables as well as
                            environmental phenomena may have also played significant roles related to changes in
                            popularity, population and productivity. The project is part of the Nalanda - Sriwijaya

                        <p>Before Koh Ker became capital of the Khmer empire (928 AD), numerous sanctuaries with
                            Shiva-lingas existed already. Koh Ker was a cult site where Shiva had been worshipped a long
                            time. Also Jayavarman IV was an ardent worshipper of this Hindu god. As later kings (whose
                            residence was not in Koh Ker) changed from Hinduism to Buddhism they gave orders to make the
                            necessary adjustments at their temples. Because of its remoteness, the sanctuaries at Koh
                            Ker were spared from these interventions.[citation needed]</p>

                        <p>Several inscriptions were found which mention Koh Ker as capital of the empire in Siem Reap,
                            Battambang, Takeo and Kampong Cham (city).[7] From inscriptions discovered at Koh Ker, it is
                            estimated that more than ten thousand people lived at Koh Ker when it was the capital (928 –
                            944 AD). The inscriptions explain how manpower was organised: taxes in form of rice were
                            raised in the whole country and served to provide for the workers who came from different
                            provinces. An inscription at Prasat Damrei says that the shrine on the top of the state
                            temple (Prang) houses a lingam of about 4.5 m (14 ft 9 in) and that the erection of this
                            Shiva-symbol gave a lot of problems". A Sanskrit inscription at Prasat Thom gives evidence
                            of the consecration of a Shiva-lingam 921 AD which was worshipped under the name of
                            Tribhuvaneshvara ("Lord of the Threefold World").[1]: 22 </p>

                        <p>None of the immense, expressive and beautiful sculptures are left at the site. Numerous of
                            them were stolen and are standing now in museums and also in private collections. Some
                            statues were put away by government organizations to protect them from looters. Many
                            masterpieces of Koh Ker are now in the collection of the National Museum in Phnom
                            Penh.[citation needed]</p>
                        <p>In late 2011, the remote location drew media attention worldwide when Sotheby's attempted to
                            sell a statue of a mythical Khmer Empire warrior. In March 2012, the US and Cambodian
                            governments filed court documents[8] to seize the statue that they purport was illegally
                            removed from the site. A twin statue, also linked to the Koh Ker site, is on display at the
                            Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, California.[citation needed]</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>The center of the ancient city was in the north-east corner of the baray (water-tank).
                            Inscriptions say at least ten thousand inhabitants lived there during the rule of Jayavarman
                            IV. Past researchers believed a square wall with a side length of 1.2 km (1,312 yd)
                            protected the town. But new research indicates that the linear structures found in this part
                            of Koh Ker were dykes of ancient canals. Concerning the wooden buildings of the Khmer time
                            no artefacts are found.[citation needed]</p>
                        <p>Laterite, sandstone and brick were used as construction materials in Koh Ker. Laterite and
                            sandstone of excellent quality were quarried in great quantities in the region of Koh Ker,
                            so the transport of the stones to the site was no problem. The bricks produced were small,
                            regular and very solid. A thin layer of organic mortar of unknown formula was used, possibly
                            some form of plant sap. After more than a millennium the brick sanctuaries in Koh Ker are in
                            a much better condition than the laterite ones. The roofs of some temples in Koh Ker had a
                            wood construction and were covered with tiles. In these monuments, holes for the wooden
                            girders are found. The main sanctuary (the temple-complex Prasat Thom/Prang) was not
                            standing in the middle of the ancient city.[1]: 16–17 </p>

                        <p>The huge Baray (water-tank) called Rahal is the largest object at the site of the ancient
                            capital Koh Ker. Its length is about 1,200 m (1,312 yd) and its breath about 560 m (612 yd).
                            The water-tank has three dams covered by steps of laterite. The orientation of the Rahal is
                            not from east to west like the huge water-reservoirs in Angkor; it follows an orientation of
                            North 15° West. Because the most important monuments at Koh Ker have the same orientation it
                            is thought that the Baray was constructed first and the rest of the structures were laid out
                            around it. The Rahal was carved out partly of the stone ground but it is not clear if a
                            natural hollow was the reason for its orientation. These days most parts of the Baray are
                            dried out and covered by grass. Some puddles can be seen in the corner next to the
                            double-sanctuary.[9]</p>

                        <p>200 m (219 yd) south of the double-sanctuary Prasat Thom/Prang is a basin dug into the earth
                            with a length of 40 m (44 yd). It has steps of laterite on all sides. During the rainy
                            season the water is standing to a depth of 7 m (23 ft 0 in). The Trapeang Andong Preng does
                            not belong to a temple, but it could have been a royal bath, because near this place was
                            once the wooden palace of the king.[1]: 32 </p>
